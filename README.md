# Raymarching
 Sphere Tracing Ray Marching Algorithm Implementation with Algorithm Illustration
 
 Sphere Tracing is a technique where a ray is fired in any direction and a sphere is placed at the start at the ray, with its radius equal to the shortest distance to any object.
 This step is repeated per ray iteration until the radius of the circle created is exceedingly small, as once this happens there is a collision with an object.
